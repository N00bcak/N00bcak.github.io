Whitehacks 2021, just ONE week after DSO-NUS CTF, was my second local CTF of 2021. 
It was quite fast-paced and enjoyable because the CTF lasted only 8 hours in total.

Surprisingly, the Cryptography challenges in this CTF were a lot harder than expected. I only managed to solve one challenge in total, and so despite my team and I achieving 3rd place in the end, I am not satisfied. >:(

(Perhaps I will open a tinkering section to discuss and make notes on past CTF challenges/random projects. Just maybe.)

There will be unfortunately no writeups because any recollection of the CTF has been wiped by my utterly exam- and commitment-packed schedule (sorry :<). But you can always check out the [Sieberrsec writeups](https://github.com/IRS-Cybersec/ctfdump)! :D

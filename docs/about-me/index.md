## That's a *pretty* purple screen.
Thank you I appreciate it. uwu

## Anyways who are you?
* I am N00bcak, a University student who likes Deep Learning, CTFs, and Mathematics.
* Right now I'm focused on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and playing around more generally in the field of Deep Learning. But I still play the occasional CTF!
* I also study Mathematics and foreign languages (German, French, Spanish, Russian etc.) as hobbies.

## What will I find here?
* Historically I've done post-CTF writeups, where I write about my thought process and reflections about solving challenges.
* I hope to start blogging more about Deep Learning and Mathematics in the future as well!

## CTF Involvement
* I'm currently a member of [NUS Greyhats](https://nusgreyhats.org/), where I specialize in AI Cybersecurity and Cryptography.
* I used to be a part of Sieberrsec. Please check out their [writeup repository](https://github.com/IRS-Cybersec/ctfdump)!

## Deep Learning Research
Check out some of the publications I contributed to below!

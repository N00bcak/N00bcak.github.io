That is, they were thought of, roughly drafted, and then left sitting in a folder until the day of the CTF came.</p><p>We have <strong>strong reason to doubt</strong> that, for example, many of the Linux challenge boxes were <strong>tested rigorously</strong>, which led to many humorous situations (and countless others less so):</p><p>Reports of Linux box passwords being tampered with, preventing competitors from even attempting the challenges to begin with.</p><p>Upon entering a pwn Docker container.

Not a good sight in a CTF.</p><p>Or, <em>that the flags were even present in some of the challenge environments in the first place</em>.</p><p>So one day, we were doing a Web challenge and our teammate discovered a <strong>directory traversal</strong> vulnerability...</p><p>After 1 hour of searching our butts off for the flag to no avail, the flag <strong>spontaneously manifested</strong> in the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file...</p><p>And it appears we weren&#39;t the only people who lost our marbles at this foul play by the organizers...</p><p>In and of themselves these were not unredeemable mistakes. The occasional unintended solution and unforeseen bug is very common in CTF events, and no one can be expected to make watertight challenges.</p><p>What <strong>WAS</strong> exasperating was the organizers&#39; absolute lack of transparency and communication whatsoever.</p><p>For starters, in changing the document in the Microbes challenge without first announcing this change to the participants (see <a href="#support">N00bcak&#39;s conversation in #support</a>)</p><p>Or, condoning bots that repeatedly leaked flags into the chat room: <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/850202940597469207/858300715084808222/unknown.png" alt=""></p><p>Perhaps most appallingly, the lax security measures on multiple servers that led to:</p><ul><li>Challenge passwords being altered after an unintended privilege escalation, robbing other participants of access to flags.</li><li>The overriding of flags, to the same effect of the previous point.</li><li>The ability of some participants to exfiltrate the flags for all Web challenges after completing just one of the challenges:</li></ul><p>Overall, their challenge creation process appeared to be extremely sloppy, riddled with a lack of accountability and unresolved errors.</p><h3 id="challenges-or-the-lack-thereof" tabindex="-1">Challenges (Or, the lack thereof) <a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-or-the-lack-thereof" aria-label="Permalink to “Challenges (Or, the lack thereof)”">​</a></h3><p><em>DISCLAIMER: This was written by a Junior category player.</em></p><p>It must be said that <strong>we are understanding</strong> of the DSTA&#39;s aims to promote information security and cybersecurity awareness among young Singaporeans. So we will <em>ignore the fact</em> that many of the challenges were <em>very different in nature</em> compared to what one would expect from, say, <a href="https://ctftime.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CTFTime</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, the difficulty disparity between this event and that of other CTFs was not only jaw-dropping, it was <strong>absolutely egregious</strong>.</p><p>To further elucidate our points of contention, we will highlight several issues with the challenges in this event in general:</p><h4 id="point-1-full-solves" tabindex="-1">Point 1: Full Solves <a class="header-anchor" href="#point-1-full-solves" aria-label="Permalink to “Point 1: Full Solves”">​</a></h4><p>Admittedly, it is a reasonable aspiration for cybersecurity agencies to make their CTF challenges on the easier side so as to <u>engage newer CTF players</u> and to <u>retain their interest</u>. Even so, they would usually try to make tougher challenges for veterans who seek more learning experiences in their CTF journey.</p><p>However, the concept of &quot;challenge&quot; seems to have flown over the heads of this year&#39;s organizers.</p><p>A cursory glance at some beginner CTFs such as the recent <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1264/tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HSCTF 8</a> and <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1320/tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TAMUCTF 2021</a> would show that CDDC&#39;s challenges were far easier and significantly less demanding than is expected of an average CTF for beginners.</p><p>Since many of the challenges were also much simpler than <a href="/writeups/2021-09-05-Cyberthon.html">even that of local CTFs</a>, an interesting phenomenon occurred, <strong>virtually unheard of</strong> in &quot;normal&quot; CTFs.</p><p>Many teams in both the Junior and Senior category managed to solve <strong>ALL</strong> the provided challenges before the stipulated time was up.</p><h4 id="point-2-lack-of-flexibility" tabindex="-1">Point 2: Lack of Flexibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#point-2-lack-of-flexibility" aria-label="Permalink to “Point 2: Lack of Flexibility”">​</a></h4><p>In spite of the repeated, in-your-face feedback that the organizers were provided with, with respect to challenge difficulty, the organizers took no measures to adapt to their unexpected situation.</p><ul><li>Instead of releasing new challenges from the Senior Category (thereby sidestepping the need to make new challenges), the organizers stuck to their original list of challenges. <ul><li>Lesson 1: Be prepared to adapt to unexpected situations.</li><li>Lesson 2: Be aware that other people also have lives to lead...</li></ul></li><li>Rather than adjusting their challenge release schedule to keep the multiple top teams engaged, the organizers <strong>stubbornly clung</strong> onto their pre-determined release schedules. <ul><li>This artificially protracted the competition, much to the dissatisfaction of participants.</li><li>Lesson: Develop (and execute) contingency plans so you don&#39;t have to infuriate everyone when you hit a roadblock.</li><li>Suggestion 1: <u>Ask your participants what THEY would like</u>.

I"Æ<p>Ã¥ngstromCTF2021 was, in all honesty, probably the most serious Iâ€™ve been on a CTFTime CTF.</p>

<p>The spread of challenge difficulties was just right for a beginner like me. While I could not do any of the harder challenges (includes my nemesis, block ciphers), I was nonetheless able to solve quite a sizable number, including some I did not think possible.</p>

<p>In the end, we reached 71st place in the CTF!</p>

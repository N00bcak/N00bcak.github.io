<p>```Keith wants to play hopscotch, but in order to make things interesting, he decides to use a random number generator to decide the number of squares n to draw for a round of hopscotch. He then creates a hopscotch board on the floor by randomly creating a sequence of ones (one square) and twos (two squares) such that the sum of all the numbers in the sequence is n. Given 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000, find the number of valid hopscotch boards (mod 10000) he can create.</p>

<p>Sample Input: 5</p>

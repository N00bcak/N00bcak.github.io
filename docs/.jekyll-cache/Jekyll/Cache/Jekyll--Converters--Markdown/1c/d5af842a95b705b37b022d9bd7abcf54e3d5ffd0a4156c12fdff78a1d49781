<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Keith wants to play hopscotch, but in order to make things interesting, 
he decides to use a random number generator to decide the number of 
squares n to draw for a round of hopscotch. He then creates a hopscotch 
board on the floor by randomly creating a sequence of ones (one square) 
and twos (two squares) such that the sum of all the numbers in the sequence
is n. Given 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000, find the number of valid hopscotch boards (mod 10000) 
he can create. 

Sample Input: 5 
Sample Output: 8

<p>Basically, find the number of sequences from <strong>ones and twos</strong> one can make that add up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>.</p>

<p>This writeup is mainly a response to the other one on <a href="https://ctftime.org/writeup/29013">CTFTime</a>.</p>

<p>While it is by no means bad (and you should go and rate the writer 5.0 for their work :O), I hope to share a more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mathematical</code> explanation for the problem solution.</p>

<h3 id="combinatorics-recurrence-relations">Combinatorics: Recurrence Relations</h3>
<p>Perhaps we should take the hopscotch board metaphor and extend it a bit further.</p>

<p>Basically, say we have a hopscotch board with a total of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> squares, where \(m \in \mathbb{Z}\).</p>

<p>(For illustration purposes, I have elected to use \(m=5\) and a badly-drawn hopscotch board.)</p>

<p>For a board with \(m+1\) squares total, we could just tack on another square at the back:</p>

<p>Similarly, for a board with \(m+2\) squares total, we could just tack on another two squares at the back:</p>

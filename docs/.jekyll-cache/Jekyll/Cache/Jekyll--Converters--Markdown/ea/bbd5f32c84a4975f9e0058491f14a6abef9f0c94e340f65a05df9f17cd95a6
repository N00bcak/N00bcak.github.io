<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Keith wants to play hopscotch, but in order to make things interesting, 
he decides to use a random number generator to decide the number of 
squares n to draw for a round of hopscotch. He then creates a hopscotch 
board on the floor by randomly creating a sequence of ones (one square) 
and twos (two squares) such that the sum of all the numbers in the sequence
is n. Given 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000, find the number of valid hopscotch boards (mod 10000) 
he can create. 

Sample Input: 5 

Sample Output: 8

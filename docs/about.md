## That's a *pretty* purple screen.
Thank you I appreciate it. uwu

## Anyways who are you?
* I am N00bcak, a JC student who likes CTFs and Mathematics.
* I'm not very good at CTFing, but I'm trying very hard to improve ever since I started in 2020!
* Outside of CTFing I study Mathematics and foreign languages (German, French, Spanish, Russian etc.) as hobbies.

## What will I find here?
* Mostly writeups post-CTFs, where I write about my thought process and reflections about solving challenges.
* Who knows what else I'll throw here?

## Why is this place so empty?
* Pinky promise I will populate this place with past and newer writeups as time goes on.

## Shameless Sieberrsec Plug
* Please do visit my CTF Team's [writeup repository]("https://github.com/IRS-Cybersec/ctfdump") as well!
